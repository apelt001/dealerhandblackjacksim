This is a new project of mine, one that many people have probably done before. The goal is to simulate blackjack hands for the dealer
and approximate the bust rates given the card the dealer is showing. Further projects include finding out when to split pairs or not,
and validating the well known basic strategy card first created by Ed Thorpe (https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/blackjack-strategy-charts/)

So far:
  An efficient simulation of blackjack dealer hands and different bust rates given the dealer up-card.
